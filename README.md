# BibleTok

BibleTok is a modern, engaging Bible exploration app inspired by TikTok and [Wikitok](https://wikitok.vercle.app) It presents Bible verses in a fun, swipeable interface while maintaining reverence for scripture.

## Why? 

A few reasons: 
- I'm a big fan of WikiTok and a friend suggested someone could do that but with Bible verses. 
- I've never used Next.JS and wanted to learn it. 
- I wanted to see how far I could get with #vibecoding. This was built using the Claude iOS App (I actually dictated the original though via voice), Github Codespaces, and Claude Code. I never actually ran this locally on a full-featured computer. Most of the development was done on iPad. 

## ‚ú® Features

- **Verse Discovery**: Swipe through hand-picked Bible verses in an engaging format
- **Multiple Translations**: Access various English Bible translations
- **Save Favorites**: Mark your favorite verses for quick access later
- **Full PWA Support**: Install on mobile devices as a standalone app
